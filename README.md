# Majorana Transverse-Field Ising Model (TFIM) Simulator

## Overview  
This project implements numerical simulations of an extended 1D transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) using Majorana fermion representation. It constructs the Hamiltonian, computes eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and analyzes quantum phase transitions through energy gap and eigenvector visualization. The goal is to study topological phases and critical phenomena in this model.

## Features  
- Construction of Majorana TFIM Hamiltonian with nearest and next-nearest neighbor couplings.  
- Computation of eigenvalue spectrum and identification of energy gaps.  
- Visualization of eigenvectors to detect edge-localized Majorana zero modes.  
- Phase diagram generation mapping energy gaps over parameter space (\(\lambda_1, \lambda_2\)).  
- Modular design with clear separation of Hamiltonian construction, transformations, and plotting utilities.

## Requirements  
- Python 3.8+  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  

Install dependencies using:
